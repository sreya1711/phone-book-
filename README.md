### 🧠 How It Works

The app stores contacts in memory using a **Binary Search Tree**, where each node holds:
- A name (as key)
- A phone number
- Pointers to left/right subtrees

All operations like **insert**, **search**, **delete**, and **in-order traversal** are performed on the BST logic implemented in JavaScript.
